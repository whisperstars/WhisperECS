# @whisperstars/WhisperECS

An efficient and lightweight Entity Component System (ECS) implementation in TypeScript, designed for game development and other ECS-based architectures.
It now includes a robust serialization/deserialization mechanism, making it suitable for scenarios where game state persistence, networking, or save/load functionalities are required.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @whisperstars/ecs
```

## Upcoming Features and Improvements
